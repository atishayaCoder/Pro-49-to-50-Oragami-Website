        Personal Recommendations:

        - 6" square paper
        
        - Foil paper
        
        - Single-sided paper
        
        Time:
        
        Takes me about 10 minutes to fold one if I am taking my time, but learning it may take 30-45 minutes, depending on what you already know.
    
        Steps - 
            Step 1: Begin With a Square Piece of Paper. ...
            Step 2: Fold the Paper in Half Diagonally. ...
            Step 3: Fold This Triangle in Half Again. ...
            Step 4: Open One of the Triangle Flaps. ...
            Step 5: Fold All Sides of the Square to the Crease in the Middle. ...
            Step 6: Open the Model, and Flatten Into a Crane Base. ...
            Step 7: Create a Sink Fold.
            Step 8: Fold the Sides Down.
            Step 9: Fold the Open Flaps Into an "X"
            Step 10: Undo and Collapse.
            Step 11: Fold the Bottom Half of the Model Out.
            Step 12: Make an Inside Reverse Fold.
            Step 13: Open One Flap and Collapse.
            Step 14: Fold the Dragon's Wings Up.
            Step 15: Fold the Head and Front Feet.
            Step 16: Make the Back Feet.
            Step 17: Optional: Crimp Fold the Tail.
